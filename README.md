# Weather-application
This is a web application created with JavaScript(Vanilla JavaScript : No Framework).

I have used the basics of HTML, CSS & JavaScript like JavaScript Objects, Functions etc.

This application will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (Â°C) in Celcius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country.
When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it form Celcius to Fahrenheit.

I used the API for getting the weather details. The API provider is : http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org

Thankyou!!!
